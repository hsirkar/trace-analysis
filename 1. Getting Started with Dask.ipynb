    "# Getting Started with Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dask** is a library for parallel computing in Python. It works by \"chunking\" large datasets into smaller datasets, and performing computations on the smaller datasets in parallel. For instance, it can break up a large Pandas DataFrame of 100k rows into 10 Pandas DataFrames of 10k rows. Then, when we want to perform some operation on the large 100k-row DataFrame, the Dask scheduler will schedule 10 tasks to be performed in parallel (in fact, it will determine and only schedule the tasks that are absolutely necessary for the final result).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will get us accustomed to the way Dask works cooperatively with Pandas. It assumes familiarity with Pandas DataFrames and basic operations like indexing and aggregations."

This way, Dask can determine exactly which tasks it needs to do to get the final result, instead of greedily doing everything.\n",

In regular Python or NumPy, we would have to generate the entire matrix, generate all the random values, and then compute the average value across the first row. We wasted time doing unnecessary work (i.e. generating the rest of the matrix). Dask, however, does not immediately generate the matrix. It waits until we need the result, and only does the work that's absolutely necessary (i.e. only fills the first row). It does this by building up a task graph, and dynamically ordering it based on the dependencies.\n",

    "**To summarize:** Dask lets us perform parallel computing on different data structures, including Pandas DataFrames, by chunking the data structure into smaller subproblems, and solving the appropriate subproblems in parallel. Dask uses *lazy evaluation*, which means it doesn't execute tasks immediately when task are defined. Instead, it builds up a task graph (DAG), and only computes the result when explicitly specified. This way, it optimizes the execution plan, and only performs executions that are necessary for the final result.\n",

    "Dask also has its own scheduler, which is responsible for assigning tasks to available worker threads/processes, and ensuring that the dependencies in the task graph are satisfied.\n",
